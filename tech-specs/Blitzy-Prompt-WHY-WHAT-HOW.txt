Blitzy Prompt (WHY / WHAT / HOW)

WHY
Autonomously build & operate Veria dev using our existing OIDC/WIF pipeline, deploying `ai-broker` to Cloud Run by digest with private‑only access. Produce a clear ops report + rollback plan.

WHAT
- Build, push, deploy `ai-broker` (private‑only).
- Provide post‑deploy report (URL, digest, revision, traffic).
- Confirm logs in Cloud Logging.
- Do not alter OIDC/WIF, IAM, or branch protections.

HOW
- Use `.github/workflows/cd.yml` (OIDC `auth@v2`, linux/amd64).
- Use existing Artifact Registry path; deploy by DIGEST only.
- CI auth via `veria-automation@veria-dev.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
- Request runtime env/secrets and mount via Secret Manager.
