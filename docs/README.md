- 🔴 No test coverage (<5%)

### What's Working
- ✅ Gateway Service (90% complete)
- ✅ Database schema designed
- ✅ Docker infrastructure ready
- ✅ Tool Masker configurations defined

## 🎯 Quick Start for Developers

### First Time Setup
1. Read **[IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)** to understand current state
2. Review **[SPRINT_PLAN.md](./SPRINT_PLAN.md)** for immediate tasks
3. Check **[PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md](./PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md)** for workflow

### Daily Development
1. Check current sprint tasks in **[SPRINT_PLAN.md](./SPRINT_PLAN.md)**
2. Update progress in **[IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md)**
3. Reference **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** for system design

## 📊 Development Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Services Working | 1/5 | 5/5 | 🔴 Critical |
| Test Coverage | <5% | 80% | 🔴 Critical |
| API Endpoints | 8/25 | 25/25 | 🟡 In Progress |
| Database Connected | 0/5 | 5/5 | 🔴 Critical |

## 🚀 Next Immediate Actions

### Day 1 (CRITICAL)
1. Create Compliance Service implementation
2. Fix Audit Service read endpoints
3. Fix Policy Service routes

### Day 2-3
1. Connect services to PostgreSQL
2. Set up Redis caching
3. Create test infrastructure
4. Write unit tests (40% coverage)
