# Veria Development Roadmap

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Active Development

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a realistic path from the current state (15% complete) to a production-ready MVP. Based on actual code analysis, we need to rebuild core services, implement missing features, and establish proper testing infrastructure before moving to advanced features.

## Current State Assessment

### What's Actually Working
- **Gateway Service**: 90% complete, routing functional
- **Database Schema**: Well-designed, ready to use
- **Infrastructure**: Docker setup complete
- **Tool Masker**: Specifications ready for implementation

### What Needs Work
- **Compliance Service**: 0% - Completely missing
- **Identity Service**: 30% - Mock implementation only
- **Policy Service**: 40% - No database integration
- **Audit Service**: 35% - Missing read endpoints
- **Frontend**: 10% - Single page exists
- **Testing**: <5% - Almost no tests
