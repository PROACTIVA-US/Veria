# DevAssist Conflict Validation Report

## Files That Could Conflict - NOW REMOVED ✅

### Critical Conflicts (Would Break `/initproject`)
1. **`.mcp.json` files in worktrees** - REMOVED ✅
   - These pointed to old DevAssist setup
   - Would conflict with new MCP configuration

2. **`.claude/commands/session*.md` files** - REMOVED ✅
   - Referenced non-existent DevAssist scripts
   - Would cause errors when commands are run

3. **`.sessions/` directory** - REMOVED ✅
   - Old session data with DevAssist references
   - Clean start is better

## Files That WON'T Conflict - SAFE TO KEEP ✅

### Documentation Only (No Functional Impact)
1. **`/devassist/` folders in worktrees**
   - Just documentation about flows/prompts
   - Not actual DevAssist configuration
   - Won't interfere with `/initproject`

2. **`CLAUDE.md` files**
   - Just documentation mentioning DevAssist
   - No functional impact

3. **`CONSOLIDATION_COMPLETE.md` files**
   - Historical documentation
   - No functional impact

4. **`docs/archive/NEXT_STEPS_STRATEGIC.md`**
   - Archived documentation
   - No functional impact

5. **`CLEANUP-COMPLETE.md`**
   - Just our cleanup documentation
   - No functional impact

## Validation Summary

### ✅ SAFE TO RUN `/initproject`

All potentially conflicting files have been removed:
- No `.devassist/` configuration directories
- No `.mcp.json` files 
- No DevAssist command scripts
- No session scripts

The remaining references to "devassist" are only in:
- Documentation files (`.md`)
- Project flow descriptions
- Historical logs

**These will NOT conflict with the new `/initproject` setup.**

## What `/initproject` Will Create

When you run `/initproject` in Claude Code, it will create:
- New `/Projects/Veria/.devassist/` directory
- Fresh `server.js` with Veria-specific commands
- New `package.json` for dependencies
- New `.mcp.json` configuration
- Commands like `/start-veria`, `/end-veria`, etc.

None of this will conflict with the existing project files.
