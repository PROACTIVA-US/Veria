# üéØ VERIA PROJECT - STRATEGIC NEXT STEPS

## üìä Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
1. **Clean Architecture** - Well-organized monorepo with clear separation of concerns
2. **Blockchain Foundation** - Solid Polygon provider with production-ready features (connection pooling, retry logic, gas optimization)
3. **Service Structure** - Gateway, identity, policy, and audit services scaffolded
4. **DevAssist Integration** - AI-powered development assistance configured
5. **Documentation** - Clear PRD and technical roadmap

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gaps to Address**
1. **Frontend** - Empty frontend app (only .next build folder)
2. **Service Implementation** - Services are minimal stubs
3. **Database Schema** - Not yet implemented despite being marked complete
4. **Integration Tests** - Framework not built (0% coverage)
5. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Not configured

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 1: Database & Core Models** [CRITICAL PATH]
The database is the foundation - without it, services can't store data.

```bash
# Actions:
1. Implement PostgreSQL schema for:
   - Users/Accounts (KYC/KYB status)
   - Products (Tokenized assets)
   - Transactions (Subscriptions/Redemptions)
   - Compliance (Rules, Checks, Audit logs)

2. Create Alembic migrations:
   cd packages/database
   alembic init migrations
   # Create initial schema migration
   alembic revision -m "initial_schema"
   
3. Set up seed data for development
```

**Files to create:**
- `packages/database/schemas/core.sql`
- `packages/database/models.py` (expand existing)
- `packages/database/seeds/dev_data.py`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 1-2: Implement Gateway Service** [CRITICAL PATH]
The gateway is your API entry point - needs proper implementation.

```javascript
// services/gateway/src/index.js needs:
- Authentication middleware (JWT)
- Rate limiting
- Request validation
- Route registration for all services
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- OpenAPI documentation
```

**Key Features:**
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (Issuer, Investor, Compliance Officer)
- Prometheus metrics endpoint
- Health checks for all downstream services

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 2: Identity Service Implementation** [HIGH PRIORITY]
Core KYC/KYB functionality for investor onboarding.

```typescript
// services/identity-service/src/index.ts needs:
- KYC/KYB workflow engine
- Document verification
- Sanctions screening (Chainalysis API)
- Accreditation checks
- Identity storage with PII encryption
```

**Integrations needed:**
- Chainalysis/ComplyAdvantage for sanctions
- Jumio/Onfido for document verification
- Parallel Markets for accreditation

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 2-3: Smart Contract Deployment** [BLOCKCHAIN CRITICAL]
Deploy ERC-3643 contracts for tokenized treasuries.

```bash
# Actions:
1. Complete ERC-3643 implementation
   cd packages/blockchain/contracts
   # Implement Identity Registry
   # Implement Compliance Module
   # Implement Transfer Rules

2. Deploy to Mumbai testnet
3. Verify contracts on Polygonscan
4. Create deployment scripts
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 3: Frontend Dashboard** [USER EXPERIENCE]
Build the essential UI for MVP.

```bash
# Create React/Next.js frontend with:
cd apps/frontend
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app

# Key pages:
- /onboarding - KYC/KYB flow
- /products - Available tokenized assets
- /portfolio - Holdings & transactions
- /compliance - Admin dashboard
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 3-4: Integration Testing** [QUALITY]
Build comprehensive test coverage.

```bash
# Set up testing framework
cd tests/e2e
npm install @playwright/test
# Write tests for critical paths:
- Investor onboarding flow
- Subscription/redemption flow
- Compliance checks
```

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Week 4: CI/CD Pipeline** [AUTOMATION]
Automate testing and deployment.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Run tests on PR
- Build Docker images
- Deploy to staging on merge
- Security scanning (Snyk/Dependabot)
```

## üìã Quick Start Commands for Tomorrow

```bash
# 1. Start development environment
cd /Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Veria
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Set up database
cd packages/database
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head

# 3. Start gateway service development
cd services/gateway
npm install
npm run dev

# 4. In another terminal, start identity service
cd services/identity-service
npm install
npm run dev

# 5. Start DevAssist for AI assistance
./devassist-session.sh
```

## üéØ Success Metrics for Next 2 Weeks

### Must Have (MVP Critical):
- [ ] Database schema implemented and migrated
- [ ] Gateway service with auth/routing
- [ ] Identity service with basic KYC
- [ ] One ERC-3643 contract deployed to testnet
- [ ] Basic frontend with onboarding flow

### Should Have:
- [ ] 70% test coverage
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running
- [ ] Policy service for compliance rules
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates

### Nice to Have:
- [ ] Audit service logging all actions
- [ ] Admin dashboard
- [ ] Multi-chain support (Ethereum mainnet)
- [ ] Performance monitoring (Grafana)

## üî• Most Important First Step

**TOMORROW MORNING:**
1. Implement the PostgreSQL database schema
2. Get the gateway service properly running with authentication
3. Deploy your first ERC-3643 contract to Mumbai testnet

These three items unblock everything else. Without data persistence, API routing, and smart contracts, nothing else can progress.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use DevAssist** - Start each session with `/session-start` in Claude
2. **Commit Often** - Small, focused commits are easier to review
3. **Test First** - Write tests before implementing features
4. **Document APIs** - Use OpenAPI/Swagger from the start
5. **Security First** - Implement auth/encryption early

## üö® Risk Mitigation

**Biggest Risk**: Trying to do everything at once
**Solution**: Focus on one vertical slice - get one complete flow working (investor onboarding) before expanding

**Second Risk**: Complex blockchain integration
**Solution**: Start with mock contracts, implement real ones in parallel

**Third Risk**: Compliance requirements
**Solution**: Partner with a compliance provider (ComplyAdvantage/Chainalysis) early

## RECOMMENDED ACTION: Start with Database Schema

The database is your foundation. Without it, nothing else works. Open `packages/database/schemas/core.sql` and start defining your tables. I can help you write the schema if you'd like!
