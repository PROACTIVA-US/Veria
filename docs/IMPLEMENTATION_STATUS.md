```

## Success Metrics for Sprint 1

### Must Have (Definition of Done)
- [ ] All 5 services respond to health checks
- [ ] Compliance Service exists and handles /decisions
- [ ] Audit Service can read and write logs
- [ ] Policy Service uses PostgreSQL
- [ ] 40% test coverage achieved
- [ ] Services can communicate with each other
- [ ] `pnpm run dev:all` starts everything

### Nice to Have
- [ ] 60% test coverage
- [ ] Redis caching implemented
- [ ] Basic authentication working
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Risk Assessment

### 🔴 High Risk
1. **Compliance Service Missing**: Blocks all compliance features
2. **No Tests**: High risk of bugs and regressions
3. **Database Not Connected**: Data loss risk
4. **No Authentication**: Security vulnerability

### 🟡 Medium Risk
1. **Performance Unknown**: No load testing done
2. **Tool Masker Complex**: May take longer than estimated
3. **Smart Contracts**: Security audit needed
4. **Frontend Delays**: Depends on backend completion

### 🟢 Low Risk
1. **Infrastructure Ready**: Docker setup complete
2. **Schema Designed**: Database structure defined
3. **Gateway Working**: Core routing functional

## Team Recommendations

### Minimum Team Size
- 2 Backend Engineers (Services)
- 1 Frontend Engineer
- 1 DevOps/QA Engineer

### Ideal Team Size
- 3 Backend Engineers
- 2 Frontend Engineers
- 1 Blockchain Engineer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 QA Engineer

## Next Steps

1. **Assign Sprint 1 Tasks**: Use SPRINT_PLAN.md
2. **Fix Critical Issues**: Compliance Service first
3. **Set Up Testing**: Jest/Vitest infrastructure
4. **Daily Standups**: Track progress
5. **Update This Document**: After each sprint
