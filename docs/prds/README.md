# Veria Product Requirement Docs (PRDs)

This folder contains detailed PRDs for Veriaâ€™s first core modules.  
Blitzy can use these to scaffold features, build services, and track progress.  

## Included PRDs
- **QuickBooks Connector** (`quickbooks_connector_prd.md`)  
  Syncs tokenized asset transactions into QuickBooks/Xero.  

- **Compliance Dashboard** (`compliance_dashboard_prd.md`)  
  Web dashboard with real-time tokenized asset + compliance visibility.  

- **Tax Reporting Engine** (`tax_reporting_prd.md`)  
  Automates IRS-ready tax forms for tokenized assets.  

- **API Gateway & Middleware** (`api_gateway_prd.md`)  
  API-first layer for fintech, CPA, and enterprise integrations.  

## How to Use with Blitzy
