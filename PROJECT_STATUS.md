# Veria Platform - Project Status & Cleanup Plan

**Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Version**: 0.4.0  
**Phase**: Foundation Cleanup & Sprint Planning

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Veria is a Real World Asset (RWA) distribution middleware platform at approximately 40% completion. The project requires immediate cleanup, documentation updates, and a clear sprint plan to reach MVP by November 1, 2025.

## 📊 Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Working
- **Core Services Structure**: All 5 main services have basic implementation
  - Gateway Service (port 3001) - Routing and proxy working
  - Identity Service (port 3002) - Basic JWT auth implemented
  - Policy Service (port 3003) - In-memory storage functional
  - Compliance Service (port 3004) - Basic structure in place
  - Audit Log Writer (port 3005) - Write operations working

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Docker Compose configuration complete
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant containers configured
  - Makefile with common operations
  - pnpm workspace configuration

- **Additional Services Started**:
  - Blockchain Service - Smart contract integration foundation
  - KYC Provider - External provider abstraction
  - Tool Masker - API abstraction layer
  - Regulatory Reporting - Report generation framework

### 🔧 What Needs Fixing

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - Compliance Service missing complete implementation
   - Audit Service lacks read endpoints
   - Policy Service needs database integration (currently in-memory)
   - No actual database schema implementation
   - Test coverage minimal (<20%)

2. **Documentation Chaos**:
   - Multiple conflicting roadmap documents
   - Outdated sprint plans
   - Duplicate and obsolete files
   - Missing API documentation

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Many uncommitted changes (40+ files)
   - Deleted files not cleaned up
   - No clear development workflow
   - CI/CD pipeline incomplete

## 🗺️ Cleanup Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Cleanup (Week 1)
1. **Git Repository Cleanup**
   - Commit or revert all pending changes
   - Remove obsolete documentation
   - Consolidate roadmap documents
   - Clean up deleted file references

2. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Single source of truth for roadmap
   - Clear sprint planning document
   - Updated architecture documentation
   - Current implementation status

3. **Service Stabilization**
   - Fix Compliance Service implementation
   - Add Audit Service read endpoints
   - Connect Policy Service to database
   - Verify all health checks

### Phase 2: Foundation Strengthening (Week 2)
1. **Database Layer**
   - Implement proper schema
   - Set up migrations
   - Create seed data
   - Test database connections

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up test databases
   - Implement unit tests for critical paths
   - Add integration tests
   - Configure CI pipeline

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Clear branching strategy
   - PR templates
   - Code review process
   - Deployment procedures
