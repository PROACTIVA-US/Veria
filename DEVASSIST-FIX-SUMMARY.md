# DevAssist Session-Start Troubleshooting Summary

## Problems Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Empty Database** âœ… FIXED
- Veria.db was 0 bytes
- Created tables and populated with actual project data

### 2. **Stale STATUS.md** âœ… FIXED  
- Removed outdated "MCP parsing issue"
- Updated with current tasks

### 3. **Console.log Breaking MCP Protocol** âœ… FIXED
- Console.log statements with emojis were sent to stdout
- MCP expects only JSON on stdout
- Commented out all console.log statements

### 4. **Syntax Errors in warmup.js** âœ… FIXED
- `toolsToP rime` had a space â†’ fixed to `toolsToPrime`
- `estimatedImprovem ent` had a space â†’ fixed to `estimatedImprovement`
- These typos broke the entire module

### 5. **Path Configuration Issues** âœ… FIXED
- DevAssist was trying to create `/.devassist/data` at root
- Fixed to use proper project paths

## Current State:

When you restart Claude and run `/session-start`:

1. **DevAssist should load properly** (syntax errors fixed)
2. **Warm-up should complete** (no more JSON errors)
3. **Database has real data** (populated with tasks)
4. **Should show actual priorities** not stale info

## What You Saw vs What Should Happen:

### What You Saw:
- Claude manually doing warm-up with bash commands
- Presenting options 1-4 at the end
- DevAssist tools not being used

### What Should Happen Next Time:
- DevAssist `start_session` tool runs
- Automatic warm-up with metrics
- Shows: "Starting: Integration testing framework (Priority 1)"
- Begins actual work, not presenting options

## The Root Causes:

1. **Typos in code** broke the module completely
2. **Console.log to stdout** violated MCP protocol
3. **Empty database** meant no context to load
4. **Stale documentation** provided wrong information

All of these are now fixed. The session should work properly after restarting Claude!

## To Verify It's Working:

After restart, when you run `/session-start`, you should see:
- ðŸ”¥ Warm-up metrics (if debug is enabled)
- Actual current tasks from database
- Immediate action like "Starting integration test framework"
- NOT "Choose your focus 1-4"
