## Date: September 6, 2025

## What Was Integrated:

### Services Added/Updated:
- ✅ Compliance Service (NEW) - Full implementation with evidence bundle
- ✅ Policy Service - Enhanced with Prisma persistence
- ✅ Gateway Service - Enhanced with routing, CORS, request-ID
- ✅ Audit Writer Service - Updated with viewer endpoints
- ✅ Identity Service - Updated configuration

### Frontend Updates:
- ✅ Admin pages structure prepared
- ✅ Product pages structure added
- ⚠️ Frontend package.json needs manual update

### Infrastructure:
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
- ✅ Dockerfiles for all services
- ✅ Docker compose files referenced
- ✅ Service architecture complete

### Configuration:
- ✅ Zod validation for services
- ✅ Request-ID propagation
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Environment variable validation

## Services Architecture:

```
services/
├── gateway/           # API Gateway (port 3001)
├── identity-service/  # Identity/KYC (port 3002)  
├── policy-service/    # Policy Engine (port 3003)
├── compliance-service/# Compliance (port 3004)
└── audit-log-writer/ # Audit Trail (port 3005)
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Generate Prisma client for policy service:**
   ```bash
   pnpm --filter @veria/policy-service prisma:generate
   ```

3. **Start development environment:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using pnpm
   pnpm run dev:all
   
   # Option 2: Using Docker
   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

4. **Verify services:**
   - Gateway: http://localhost:3001/health
   - Identity: http://localhost:3002/health
   - Policy: http://localhost:3003/health
   - Compliance: http://localhost:3004/health
   - Audit: http://localhost:3005/health

## Bundle Integration Summary:

| Bundle | Feature | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| 06 | Gateway routing and frontend wiring | ✅ Complete |
| 07 | Evidence bundle and audit UI | ✅ Complete |
| 09 | Policy persistence with Prisma | ✅ Complete |
| 10 | CI/CD and Dockerfiles | ✅ Complete |
| 11 | UI hardening and config validation | ✅ Complete |

## What Still Needs Work:

1. **Frontend Integration** - The frontend app needs its dependencies updated
2. **Database Migrations** - Run Prisma migrations for policy service
3. **Redis Caching** - Continue with Sprint 1, Day 2 tasks
4. **Testing** - Run comprehensive tests across all services
5. **Smart Contracts** - Week 3 sprint work

## Critical Files Added:

- `/services/compliance-service/*` - New service
- `/services/policy-service/prisma/` - Database schema
- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- Service Dockerfiles - Container definitions
- Enhanced gateway with routing

All core services are now in place and ready for development!
