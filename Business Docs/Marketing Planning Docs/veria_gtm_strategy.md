# Veria Go-to-Market Strategy & Industry Implications

---

## 1. Overview
Veria is a compliance-first middleware and distribution layer for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). While the initial wedge focuses on Treasuries, money market funds, and other financial assets, the broader implications extend into **law, lending, healthcare, and government systems**. This document explores these verticals in depth, outlines custom interface requirements, and proposes a comprehensive go-to-market (GTM) plan.

## 2. Macro Impact
- **Lawyers**: Move from static paper/PDF agreements to programmable, tokenized contracts.
- **Lenders**: Mortgages, loans, and securitizations can be tokenized for faster liquidity.
- **Healthcare**: Patient rights, medical claims, and IP licensing become programmable assets.
- **Veteran’s Administration (VA)**: Benefits, entitlements, and medical access rights can be tokenized for transparency, portability, and efficiency.

Veria positions itself as the **compliance and distribution infrastructure** that underpins this shift.
