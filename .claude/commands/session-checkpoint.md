# ðŸ’¾ Creating Session Checkpoint

I'll save a checkpoint of the current progress using DevAssist.

## Checkpoint includes:
- Current timestamp
- Changes since last checkpoint
- Tasks completed
- Architectural decisions made
- Code modifications tracked
- Tool usage patterns (for warm-up optimization)
- Next steps identified

## Using the DevAssist session_checkpoint tool...

This checkpoint will:
- Preserve current context for future sessions
- Update warm-up data for better tool proactivity
- Record progress in the knowledge base
- Save terminal logs if active

Continue working after checkpoint, or use `/session-end` to finish.

*Checkpoints improve next session's warm-up effectiveness*
