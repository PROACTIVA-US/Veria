description: Save a checkpoint during the AI Compliance Middleware session
---

Save a progress checkpoint during the current AI Compliance Middleware development session.

Execute:
```bash
!/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/ai-compliance-middleware/scripts/session-manager.sh checkpoint
```

This will:
1. Prompt for a progress note
2. Save the checkpoint to the session file
3. Run a quick test check (pytest --co)
4. Check if API is running (health endpoint)
5. Keep DevAssist MCP running

Use checkpoints to:
- Mark completion of subtasks
- Record performance measurements
- Note discovered issues
- Save before major changes
- Document API endpoint implementations

Example progress notes:
- "Implemented /decide endpoint with jurisdiction checking"
- "API response time: 45ms with Redis caching enabled"
- "Found issue: Poetry lock file conflicts with numpy version"
- "Added Qdrant vector storage integration"
- "Edge proxy authentication middleware complete"
- "Test coverage increased to 82%"
- "Docker compose configuration working with all services"

Checkpoints help maintain a detailed work log for DevAssist learning and provide context for future sessions.

Quick checks available at checkpoint:
- Test status: `poetry run pytest --co -q`
- API health: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
- Edge proxy: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- Docker status: `docker compose ps`
