# Veria DevAssist Cleanup Complete

## What Was Removed:

### Main Project Directory (`/Projects/Veria/`)
- ✅ `.devassist/` directory (completely removed)
- ✅ `.mcp.json` (MCP configuration)
- ✅ `DEVASSIST-INIT-REPORT.md`
- ✅ `DEVASSIST-STATUS.md`
- ✅ `WORKTREE-SETUP.md`
- ✅ `migrate-worktrees.sh`
- ✅ `reconfigure-agents.sh`
- ✅ `setup-worktrees.sh`

### Worktrees Directory (`/Projects/Veria/.worktrees/`)
- ✅ All `.devassist/` directories in each worktree
- ✅ All `agent-config.json` files
- ✅ All `devassist-session.sh` scripts
- ✅ All `start-devassist.mjs` files
- ✅ `.agent-communication/` directory
- ✅ `agent-communicate.sh`
- ✅ `manage-agents.sh`
- ✅ `navigate.sh`
- ✅ `visualize-architecture.sh`
- ✅ `quick-actions.sh`
- ✅ `README.md` (in .worktrees)

## What Was Kept:

### Project Files (NOT DevAssist configs)
- ✅ `/devassist/` directories in worktrees (these contain project flows/prompts, not configs)
- ✅ Git worktrees themselves (still intact)
- ✅ All source code and project files

## Claude Code Configuration

The following entry still exists in `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
"veria-devassist": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Veria/.devassist/veria-server.js"]
}
```

This will be replaced when you run `/initproject` from Prjctzr in Claude Code.

## Next Steps:

1. **Open Claude Code** (not Claude.ai)
2. **Navigate to Veria project**
3. **Run `/initproject`** command from Prjctzr with:
   - projectPath: `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/Veria`
   - projectName: `Veria`
4. **Restart Claude Code** to load new configuration
5. **Test** `/veria-start` and other commands

## Clean Start Achieved! ✅

The Veria project is now completely clean of all DevAssist configurations and ready for a fresh initialization through Prjctzr's `/initproject` command.
