# Veria Technical Roadmap (Reprioritized: 12–24 Months)

This roadmap reflects adjustments based on deep market research into RegTech and RWA tokenization.  
Key shifts: (1) **Data normalization + Explainable AI first**, (2) **Partnership-led integrations**, (3) **Phased expansion starting with U.S. Treasuries/MMFs**.

---

## Phase 1 (Months 1–6) – Foundation First
- **Data Normalization Core**
  - Ingest + normalize data from custodians (Fireblocks, Anchorage, Coinbase Prime), tokenization platforms (Securitize, Broadridge ClearFi), blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Stellar, ZKsync), and legacy fintech/banking APIs.
  - Schema mapping + full audit trails.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**
  - Use interpretable models (rules/decision trees) where possible.
  - Apply SHAP/LIME explanations for ML-driven detections.
  - Every decision must output: *rule applied, data trigger, outcome*.
- **Regulatory Change Management (NLP)**
  - Monitor and interpret updates from SEC, FINRA, MiCA, MAS, FATF.
  - Auto-update compliance rules engine.
- **Security & Privacy by Design**
  - GDPR/CCPA-compliant PII handling.
  - Encryption-at-rest, audit logs, regulatory sandbox readiness.
- **Team**
  - Key hires: data engineering lead, XAI specialist, regulatory NLP engineer.

## Phase 2 (Months 7–12) – MVP & Beachhead Market
- **MVP Scope: U.S. Tokenized Treasuries & Money Market Funds**
  - Compliance API for:
    - KYC/AML onboarding (Plaid/Alloy).
    - Transaction screening (Chainalysis/Elliptic).
    - XAI-driven compliance reporting.
- **Pilot Programs**
  - Secure 1–2 design partners (e.g., BlackRock BUIDL, Franklin Templeton OnChain Fund).
  - Validate integrations, auditability, and ROI.
- **Partnership Integrations**
  - Custody (Fireblocks), issuance (Securitize), onboarding (Plaid), on-chain data (Chainalysis).
  - Position Veria as the neutral compliance fabric.

---

## Phase 3 (Months 13–18) – Expansion & Refinement
- **Geographic Expansion**
  - Add MiCA compliance engine for EU.
  - Implement passporting logic for CASPs.
- **New Asset Classes**
  - Tokenized private credit, real estate.
  - Extend to lifecycle events (corporate actions, cross-border tax reporting).
- **Advanced AI**
  - Predictive compliance (forecast non-compliance).
  - Risk benchmarking dashboards.

---

## Phase 4 (Months 19–24) – Network Effect & Scale
- **Commercial Launch**
  - Convert pilots to paying customers.
  - Broader custodian + exchange integrations.
- **Network Effects**
  - Become the universal compliance checkpoint across issuers, custodians, and exchanges.
- **Series A Prep**
  - Leverage case studies, regulatory endorsements, revenue traction.
- **Extended Services**
  - Analytics, risk benchmarking, cross-market compliance dashboards.

---

## Risks & Dependencies
- **XAI trust**: adoption depends on clear, auditable AI decisions.
- **Data quality**: poor ingestion/normalization undermines all compliance checks.
- **Regulatory agility**: constant updates require NLP-driven monitoring + expert advisory board.
