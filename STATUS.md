# AI Compliance Middleware - Project Status

## Current Sprint
**Sprint**: Initial Setup & Session Management  
**Started**: Not yet started  
**Target**: 2 hours max

## Active Goals
1. Set up session management system
2. Configure DevAssist integration
3. Implement core compliance endpoints
4. Set up testing framework

## System Components
- [ ] FastAPI Server: `/decide` endpoint
- [ ] Edge Proxy: Authentication middleware
- [ ] MCP Servers: Policy & lineage tracking
- [ ] Docker: Multi-service orchestration

## Performance Targets
- API Response: <200ms
- Test Coverage: >80%
- Linting: All passing

## Next Priorities
1. Implement `/decide` endpoint with jurisdiction checking
2. Add Redis caching for performance
3. Create integration tests for compliance flow
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Recent Architectural Decisions
- Use Qdrant for vector storage
- JWT for authentication
- Fastify for edge proxy
- Poetry for Python dependency management

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start API
make api

# Run tests
make test

# Check linting
make lint

# Start all services
make docker-up

# Session management
./scripts/session-manager.sh start
./scripts/session-manager.sh end
./scripts/session-manager.sh checkpoint
```

## Session Guidelines
- Max 2 hours per session
- Checkpoint every major feature
- Test coverage must stay >80%
- All commits must pass linting

## ClaudeFlow Integration
Available commands via npx:
- `npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "task"` - Multi-agent execution
- `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind wizard` - Interactive intelligence
- `npx claude-flow@alpha sparc tdd "feature"` - TDD methodology

## Notes
- DevAssist MCP tracks architectural decisions
- Session logs stored in `.sessions/`
- Terminal recordings recommended for context preservation
